Next Up:
Bug two comments and then prompt results in parser error Line 2, syntax error. Invalid token at beginning of statement: #



Backlog:
Change comment char to '//' to prevent issue printing '#' char
Don't require a blank line after a request statement
CLI feature to run a whole directory instead of just one file
Helper for reading files. Ability to parse JSON and CSV files
Make REPL automatically print response after each request
Implement cli flag for log level. Then make "npm run debug" that does "npm start --log-level=debug"
Gracefully handle error when you send a request to localhost when server is not running
Save the literal of the line of code in the Token instead of just the line number
Save previous 2 and next 2 lines of code in the Token instead of just one line
After a syntax error, print the previous and next 5 tokens and show where the invalid token was in the stream
Maybe implement semicolons to make REPL convenient
Add --allow-error flag to request commands: GET /users --allow-error

New commands:
EXIT command that calls process.exit() with a message
SLEEP command
EVAL command so you can do things like: EVAL {{ names.sort() }}
WHILE command so I can do fibonacci
