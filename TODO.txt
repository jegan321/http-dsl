Make REPL automatically print response after each request
Maybe implement semicolons to make REPL convenient
Make extension add icons for .http files
Change stringify of response and request to not include headers
Add --allow-error flag to request commands: GET /users --allow-error
Gracefully handle error when you send a request to localhost when server is not running
Add a DEBUG command that adds more logging to every request
Use mocha for test command
SLEEP command
EVAL command so you can do things like: EVAL {{ names.sort() }}
Save the literal of the line of code in the Token instead of just the line number
Save previous 2 and next 2 lines of code in the Token instead of just one line
After a syntax error, print the previous and next 5 tokens and show where the invalid token was in the stream
Don't require a blank line after a request statement
Implement cli flag for log level
Ability to read a CSV file and turn it into a 2d array automatically
Change comment char to '//' to prevent issue printing '#' char?
