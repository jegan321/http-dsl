Create test scripts for scm to see try to find bugs



Backlog:
Add documentation for query params
For loops
If statements
CLI feature to run a whole directory instead of just one file
Helper for reading files
Advanced features for VSCode extension
EXIT command that calls process.exit() with a message
JS transpiler
cURL transpiler
Make REPL automatically print response after each request
Maybe implement semicolons to make REPL convenient
